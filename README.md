Experimenting with chess logic on Javascript.

This code is pretty much Vanilla JS (some minimal RequireJS+jQuery to make dependencies & DOM manipulation easy) I coded back in 2012 when I wanted to study some Front-End for a job interview for Toronto, Canada.

You can see a few chess pieces with random colors moving around an 8x8 rid in valid movements according to the piece type. Board size and piece number are easily configurable.
